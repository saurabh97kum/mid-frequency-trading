# Mid-Frequency Trading Analysis

This repository demonstrates a mid-frequency trading strategy analysis using synthetic market data to showcase quantitative analysis, feature engineering, and classification of trading signals with Python.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Analyze synthetic market data (open, high, low, close prices) and classify trading signals.
- **Workflow:** Data exploration → Feature engineering → Model building → Evaluation → Visualization.
- **Note:** Dataset is synthetic and for demonstration purposes only.

## Files
- `synthetic_data.csv` – Synthetic market data with OHLC prices.
- `mid_frequency_trading_analysis.ipynb` – Notebook with full workflow.
- `close_price_ma.png` – Plot of moving averages on close prices.
- `feature_correlation.png` – Heatmap showing feature correlations.
- `confusion_matrix.png` – Confusion matrix for classification model.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `mid_frequency_trading_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Ensure Python 3.x is installed with packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`.
4. Run notebook cells sequentially to reproduce analysis and plots.

## Key Outputs
- Visualizations of synthetic market trends and moving averages.
- Feature correlation heatmap.
- Classification model predicting trading signals.
- Final evaluation: Accuracy ≈ 0.737, with precision, recall, and F1-score per class.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming and data handling (Pandas, NumPy).
- Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis.
- Machine learning with scikit-learn (classification, train-test split, evaluation).
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

This project highlights skills relevant to quantitative research in trading, including statistics, Python, and machine learning, aligned with mid-frequency strategy analysis.
